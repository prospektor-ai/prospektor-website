/*
 * Cookie consent (#131) — the gate, not the nag.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists, and why it does not look like a cookie banner ──
 *
 * Measured against production on 23 Aug 2026: neither prospektor.ai nor
 * studio.prospektor.ai sets a single cookie that needs consent, and neither
 * makes a third-party request. The studio's cookies are `pps_session` and the
 * two ten-minute sign-in cookies — strictly necessary, exempt under ePrivacy
 * Art. 5(3) — and its browser storage is two device preferences. The German
 * Abmahnung wave the operator has heard about is about Google Fonts served
 * from Google's CDN (self-hosted here since 18 Aug) and Google Analytics
 * without prior consent (never installed).
 *
 * So a banner offering a choice that controls nothing would not be protection.
 * Several supervisory authorities read exactly that as a dark pattern, and
 * consent collected today for a purpose that does not exist yet would not be
 * valid consent for that purpose tomorrow anyway (specific and informed,
 * GDPR Art. 4(11)). What is worth building — before Microsoft Clarity (#138),
 * which is session recording and the single most consent-hungry thing this
 * product could add — is the machinery that makes adding it safe:
 *
 *   1. an inventory that says, in one place, what non-essential thing runs;
 *   2. a gate that will not let it run before consent, so wiring it up
 *      wrongly takes effort;
 *   3. a record of the decision, because Art. 7(1) says you must be able to
 *      demonstrate it;
 *   4. withdrawal that is exactly as easy as granting (Art. 7(3));
 *   5. and, today, a truthful account of what *is* stored — which is the
 *      transparency duty that does apply right now (Art. 13).
 *
 * The banner's form follows the inventory rather than a designer's habit:
 *
 *   INVENTORY EMPTY  → a one-line **notice**: what is stored and that nothing
 *                      else is. One button, "Got it", plus "What's stored".
 *                      No fake toggle, because there is nothing to toggle.
 *   INVENTORY FILLED → a **choice**: Accept and Reject, equally weighted and
 *                      equally prominent, plus "Choose". Nothing in an opt-in
 *                      category runs until it is granted.
 *
 * Adding Clarity is therefore: one entry in INVENTORY below, and
 * `ppsConsent.gate('analytics', loadClarity)` at the call site. The banner
 * turns itself into the choice form; nobody has to remember to.
 *
 * ── Portability ──
 *
 * No dependencies, no build step, no framework, one file, classic script.
 * That is deliberate: this is copied verbatim into the website repo (#132),
 * and it would be absurd for the thing that protects us from third-party
 * scripts to be a third-party script. Colours come from the studio's CSS
 * tokens with literal fallbacks, so it also looks right on a page that has
 * never heard of `--brand-accent`.
 *
 * ── This copy: prospektor.ai (#143) ──
 *
 * Copied from the studio's `public/consent.js` on 24 Aug 2026. The reasoning
 * above is the studio's and is kept word for word, because it is the reasoning
 * that produced the file. Three things are different here, and only three:
 *
 *   1. The INVENTORY is this origin's, not the studio's. The marketing site
 *      sets **no cookie at all** — measured 24 Aug, no `set-cookie` on any
 *      response — so its whole necessary list is three browser-storage keys.
 *      The prose that named cookies and signing in went with it: an entry that
 *      is not true is worse than no panel, and that goes for the sentence
 *      above the table as much as for the table.
 *
 *   2. Netlify's Real User Metrics is declared, and gated. Re-measured against
 *      production on 24 Aug, and one fact the 23 Aug reading did not have:
 *      `/.netlify/scripts/rum` still stores nothing — no cookie, no storage of
 *      any kind, so it remains exempt under ePrivacy Art. 5(3) — but the
 *      beacon it sends on the way out is
 *      `POST https://ingesteer.services-prod.nsvcs.net/rum_collection`, a
 *      **cross-origin** request carrying the page's timings and the visitor's
 *      IP. So gating it is not only the "costs nothing, and the site is
 *      correct the day a second tool arrives" argument the handover made; it
 *      is the one third party this origin has, and consent is what now decides
 *      whether it hears from a visitor. Declaring it is also what turns this
 *      banner from a notice into a real, symmetric Accept / Reject — the form
 *      follows the inventory, exactly as designed.
 *
 *   3. It therefore carries a loader the studio's copy does not — see *the
 *      gated script* at the foot of this file. The tag is **injected by
 *      Netlify**, not written by our templates, which is the one thing the
 *      handover's step 5 could not have known; `netlify/edge-functions/
 *      rum-consent.js` takes it back out of the served HTML and leaves the
 *      loader a JSON handoff to re-create it from, under the gate.

     The one thing on this origin that runs only with consent, and the only
     part of this file the studio's copy does not have.

     Netlify injects its Real User Metrics tag into the served HTML itself,
     immediately before </body> — it is not in any template here, so there is
     no call site to wrap and no repo switch to turn it off (the toggle is in
     Netlify's own dashboard, and turning it off would lose the metrics rather
     than gate them). `netlify/edge-functions/rum-consent.js` therefore takes
     the tag back out of the response and leaves this behind in its place:

       <script type="application/json" id="ppsc-gated-rum">{"src":…}</script>

     — inert markup a browser will not fetch, execute or even parse until
     something asks it to. That something is here, behind the gate, and it is
     the only route back to a live script tag.

     If the node is absent, nothing loads and nothing breaks: locally, where
     Netlify injects nothing, that is simply the normal state. The case worth
     watching is production serving the raw tag again — the edge function
     bypassed on error, or Netlify moving the injection later in its pipeline
     — because then RUM would be loading unasked while this panel said it was
     off. That is not something a page can honestly check about itself, so it
     is checked from outside, against production, by `npm run audit`. */
