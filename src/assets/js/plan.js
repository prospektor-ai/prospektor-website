// ── THE PLAN SWITCH (#542) ──
// Monthly or yearly, on /pricing/ and on /checkout/ alike. The operator's
// call, 7 Sep 2026: "let's do the two months free thing for prepayment for
// the year" — $9,990 against $11,988, and /terms/ §02 says the price is then
// fixed for that year.
//
// This file decides NOTHING about what the page says. Both figures and both
// sentences are already in the HTML, written and translated by the build; all
// that happens here is that one of each is hidden. Three things follow, and
// each of them is why it is built this way:
//
//   - a switch can never show a price the build did not write;
//   - it ships no sentence of its own, so there is nothing to translate here
//     and nothing that can render in the wrong language;
//   - with JavaScript off, or before this runs, the page is the monthly page
//     it has always been — which is also the page a crawler reads.
//
// The choice is announced as a `plan` event on the switch rather than reached
// for by the other scripts, and this file is loaded AFTER them in the document
// so a `?plan=year` arriving from /pricing/ is heard: deferred scripts run in
// document order.
