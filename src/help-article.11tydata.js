// Data for src/help-article.njk that frontmatter cannot express (#535): a
// computed value written as a template string is always a STRING, and
// `{% if noindex %}` in the layout is true of the string "false". So the flag
// comes from the page's own entry, where src/_data/help.js decided it: an
// article the edition holds in English rather than its own language is
// written (a page must never go missing) but not offered to search; its
// English twin is the page to rank.
