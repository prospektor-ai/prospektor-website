// One email, one workspace — the guard that stands between a buyer and a
// $999 charge for a studio they already own.
//
// It proxies the studio's POST /api/provision-check (contract in
// HANDOVER-website-funnel.md §2b, live in production since 18 Aug 2026)
// because the shared secret lives server-side only, and because the studio
// deliberately does not open that endpoint cross-origin: reachable from a
// browser it would let anyone ask, address by address, who is a customer.
//
// This lives in a shared module rather than inside one function because the
// guard is now enforced where the money is committed — create-checkout-session
// will not mint a Stripe session for an address that already owns a studio —
// as well as offered early by check-email for the multi-step /checkout/ page.
// Two callers, one rule; a guard that is copy-pasted is a guard that drifts.
//
// Fail-open by design. A missing secret, an unreachable studio, a 403 or a
// shape we do not recognise all return taken:false with checked:false, and
// the sale proceeds. Blocking a paying customer because the studio hiccuped
// is a worse failure than the collision this catches, which the operator
// notice on the webhook already surfaces for a human.
