// Pre-checkout ownership check for the multi-step /checkout/ page: does this
// email already own a studio?
//
// The rule itself, the fail-open policy and the buyer-facing sentences live
// in ../lib/ownership — shared with create-checkout-session, which is where
// the guard is actually enforced (no Stripe session is minted for a taken
// address, whichever page asked). This endpoint exists so /checkout/ can say
// so a beat earlier, on its own payment step, rather than only at the moment
// it tries to open Stripe.
//
// It answers about an address the caller already typed, and only ever with
// "taken or not" plus a sentence — never with anything the studio knows that
// the buyer does not already know about themselves.
