// /checkout/done/'s one question: what did this checkout actually buy? (#244)
//
// Stripe redirects the buyer to /checkout/done/?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
// and this function trades that id back for the three facts the confirmation
// shows: the amount actually paid (a promo code can make it anything from
// $0.01 to $999 — the page must never invent a number), the address the
// workspace is tied to, and whether the session is in fact paid.
//
// The session id is the authorisation. A cs_… id is a long unguessable token
// Stripe hands only to the buyer's own redirect — the same bearer-token model
// as Stripe's own success pages — so holding it is proof enough for these
// fields. Everything else on the session (line items, the subscription id, the
// rest of the metadata) deliberately stays server-side.
//
// #622 added a fifth, on the same terms: `trial`. A Close arrival's session
// completes with `payment_status: 'no_payment_required'` — a card on file and
// nothing charged — and this page's served copy says *Payment confirmed* and
// *your receipt is on its way*, both of which are false for that buyer. One
// boolean is what it takes for the page to show the sentence that is true.
//
// #542 added a fourth, and it is the narrowest widening that would do: `plan`,
// one of exactly two words, read off the metadata the checkout call wrote. The
// order card on /checkout/done/ printed "$999/mo" as a constant, which is a
// sentence rather than a fact the moment a yearly plan exists — and the file's
// own rule two paragraphs up is that the page must never invent a number.
// Nothing else from the metadata crosses: the domain, the company and the
// buyer's target sentence stay where they are.
//
// Env-gated like every Stripe call here: no key, 503, and the page keeps its
// generic confirmation copy — a missing env var must never blank the page a
// buyer lands on seconds after paying.
