// One product, two ways to pay for it: a Prospektor workspace, $999/month or
// $9,990/year, as a subscription (CEO decision, 16 Aug 2026; the yearly plan
// is #542, the operator's call on 7 Sep 2026 — "let's do the two months free
// thing for prepayment for the year"). Both prices are inline price_data so
// no dashboard product needs to exist; promotion codes are on so
// founding-client rates are coupons the operator creates in the Stripe
// dashboard, never a code change.
//
// Env-gated: with no STRIPE_SECRET_KEY this returns 503 and every caller
// falls back to what it showed before keys existed. GET is the availability
// probe the pages use to decide which UI to show; it never creates a session.
//
// This function is the last server-side thing that happens before money can
// move, so the two things a paid session must have are enforced HERE rather
// than in whichever page called it:
//
//   1. An address that does not already own a studio (§2b ownership check).
//      The pricing CTA goes straight to Stripe, so there is no onboarding
//      page left to run that check on — it has to be structural, not a
//      convention a client remembers to follow.
//   2. A company or website to provision from. /api/provision returns 400
//      without one; the webhook would then keep returning non-2xx and Stripe
//      would redeliver for days against a buyer who has been charged $999 and
//      has no workspace. Refusing to open checkout is the cheap failure.
//
// The buyer's email is passed to Stripe as customer_email, which locks the
// field there — that is what keeps the check above meaningful, since the
// address that pays is then the address that was checked.
//
// #622: one arrival is sold differently. A visitor who came from Close's
// integration directory (`via: 'close'`, which /integrations/close/ carries in
// its own markup rather than reading off a URL anybody can type) gets the free
// month that page advertises — but only when `CLOSE_TRIAL_DAYS` arms it, and
// only for exactly the number of days the page prints. `lib/trial.js` is the
// whole rule and carries the reasoning.
