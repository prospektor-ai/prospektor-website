// No personal address in this public repository (24 Aug 2026).
//
// This repo is public, and `OPERATOR_EMAIL` on Netlify is set to the operator's
// personal address. Netlify's secrets scanning greps the repo — not only the
// build output — for the values of environment variables, so any file naming
// that address both publishes it and hard-fails every deploy. It did exactly
// that four times running on 24 Aug: a runbook named the address in a
// parenthetical aside, and production sat two days stale on the 22 Aug build
// while two boards read as pushed.
//
// The lesson is not "remember not to do that", it is this test. What it guards
// is prose — docs, runbooks, comments, copy, config — where a real address has
// no reason to appear. `test/` is deliberately out of scope: fixtures are where
// synthetic addresses belong (buyer@gmail.com is a free-mail test case, not a
// leak), and flagging them would make this test noise and get it deleted.
