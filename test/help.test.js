// /help/ — the card hub, the search, and the prerendered corpus (#145, #136).
//
// What these guard, in the order they would break:
//
//   - the operator's own screenshot query. "how can I create a new workspace"
//     returned "Nothing in the guides matches" while the corpus had answered
//     it since #83, because search matched the whole query as one substring.
//     That exact string is the regression test and it asserts the *section*,
//     not just the file — finding the right guide and dropping the reader at
//     the top of twenty-one thousand characters is only half an answer;
//   - the per-term rules that fix it: stop-words dropped, stems folded, and
//     every meaningful term required, which is the precision the old
//     whole-string match had and the reason it was worth keeping;
//   - that the served HTML actually contains the guides (#136). The page used
//     to be 6,265 bytes whose entire body copy was the nav, the H1, one
//     sentence and the word "Loading…". Since #166 that is asserted of the
//     help SECTION rather than of one file: the guides moved to /help/<slug>/,
//     one URL each, because a URL is the unit Google ranks and eleven guides
//     on one page competed as a single result. What #136 bought — every guide
//     crawlable, no "Loading…" — is unchanged, so it is checked where it now
//     lives, and the property that would silently undo it (a guide's text on
//     two URLs at once) is checked too;
//   - and the rule that a studio outage must never break a website deploy.
//     Three of these tests build the site with the endpoint dead or lying and
//     assert the build still succeeds — a build that fails because an
//     unrelated service blinked is a worse bug than the one being fixed.

/* #535 — the help section in another language.

   The studio serves the corpus per language since #113 Slice D:
   `/api/help?lang=es` answers the same files with `language: "es"` where a
   translation exists and `"en"` where it does not. What these hold, in the
   order they would break:

   - an EDITION exists exactly when its snapshot does (offline) or when the
     studio holds at least one guide in the language (live) — derived from
     `lib/i18n.js`'s language list and the studio's answer, never from a list
     of languages kept here. Nothing counts editions, guides or languages;
   - the Spanish hub and guide pages are Spanish: `<html lang="es">`, links
     under `/es/help/`, `?lang=es` asked of the studio by the scripts, and
     `hreflang` between each page and its English twin — the joint the #114
     spec named, closed from this side;
   - a guide the studio served in English on the Spanish edition is still
     written (a reader following the hub must never 404), says so, is
     `noindex`, and stays out of the sitemap — its English twin ranks;
   - a language the studio holds NO guide in gets no edition and no URL: a
     hub of English text under `/de/` is duplicate content wearing a flag. */
