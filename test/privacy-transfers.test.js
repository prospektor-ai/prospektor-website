// §08's two lists have to agree, and until #441 nothing checked that they did.
//
// The section publishes a table of who receives data, and then a sentence
// naming who among them processes it outside the EEA. Both are hand-written,
// the table is where a new recipient gets added, and the sentence is a
// paragraph below it — so for months the table said six and the sentence said
// five. The missing one was **Google**: a US recipient through OAuth sign-in
// since the studio had sign-in at all, present in the table the whole time and
// never once in the transfer sentence. Nothing was false, exactly; the sentence
// was short, which is the failure mode a reader cannot detect, because the one
// thing they use this list for is ruling a company OUT.
//
// The sentence also carried a count — *"all five providers"* — against a table
// of six. A number in prose is a second thing to keep in sync and it is the
// thing that goes stale first, so the sentence states no count now and this
// file fails if one comes back.
//
// Both checks are derived from the table rather than from a list kept here: add
// a seventh recipient and the suite names it, which is the whole point. If a
// provider is ever genuinely inside the EEA, that is the one legitimate reason
// to have a name in the table and not in the sentence — add it to
// INSIDE_THE_EEA below with the reason, the way the studio's own claims file
// keeps its exceptions in the open next to the sentence they are exceptions to.
