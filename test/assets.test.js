// Content-hashed assets (#169).
//
// The change these guard is two halves that are only correct together: the
// build writes css, js and fonts under a filename carrying a hash of their
// bytes, and `netlify.toml` answers `max-age=31536000, immutable` for exactly
// those trees. Shipping one half is worse than shipping neither — a long
// cache on an unhashed name serves a stale stylesheet for a year, and a hash
// with no header buys a repeat visitor nothing.
//
// What these guard, in the order they would break:
//   - every asset a built page names actually exists in the output. The old
//     dead-link check skipped `/assets/` because the names were fixed; now
//     they are computed, and a reference the build does not produce is a page
//     with no stylesheet;
//   - the name matches the bytes. A manifest written once and gone stale is
//     the one failure this mechanism exists to make impossible, so the hash in
//     every served filename is recomputed from the file's own contents;
//   - no page still names an unhashed path in a hashed tree — that URL is not
//     served at all any more;
//   - the headers and the hashing agree, in BOTH directions: a hashed tree
//     that lost its `immutable` header is the whole point thrown away, and an
//     `immutable` header on a tree the build does not hash is the stale-for-a-
//     year bug.
//
// Nothing here counts assets. Adding a stylesheet, a script or a font can only
// turn this red by being unhashed or unreferenced — the #131 rule, that
// friction points at the defect and never at the work.
