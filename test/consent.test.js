// What these guard, in the order they would break:
//   - the script and the withdrawal link are on EVERY page, including the ones
//     nobody thinks about (/404, /checkout/done/, every article). A consent
//     gate with a page-shaped hole in it is not a gate;
//   - the INVENTORY still names every key this site's own code writes. That is
//     the one assertion that keeps the panel honest as the site changes, and
//     the reason it is a test rather than a review habit: an entry that is not
//     true is worse than no panel;
//   - Netlify's Real User Metrics is declared as `analytics` and not smuggled
//     in as `necessary` — which is also what makes the banner a symmetric
//     Accept / Reject rather than a notice;
//   - the edge function's transform swaps Netlify's injected tag for an inert
//     handoff, keeps the token that comes with it, and refuses anything it
//     cannot hand back faithfully.
